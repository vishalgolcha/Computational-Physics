case 1: e^x , there exists no root for this .
case 2: consider function x*exp(-x*x)
	
	initial guess  greater than 1/sqrt(2)
	and smaller than -1/sqrt(2) 
	they never yield results . they dont descend to the root hence this method fails here .

case 3: consider x*(1-x)
		a bad choice for a starting point such as 0.5 yields no result as the derivative there is zero ! 
		again it won't desend to the root ! .
